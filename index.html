               <h2>PopTarts</h2>
               <p>These are some poptarts that I made during the very beginning of quarntine in 2020. I can't remember what recipe I used, but they were strawberry flavored with come basic glaze-type icing. I also made some chocolate fudge ones that I didn't take pictures of. I want to try making make some again because I feel like I could've done better with the pastry dough.</p>

               <h2>Halloween Rice Krispies and Cookies</h2>
               <p>I thought it would be fun to make some little rice krispies and make them look like ghosts, so I dipped these in white chocolate and then put some black icing eyes on them. Then I thought that it would match the color scheme of Halloween to have some kind of dark cookie to go with them. These ones are supposed to be a copycat recipe of a Crumbl cookie. </p>
